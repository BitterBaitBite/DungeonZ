# DungeonZ

This repository features a 2D game done with SFML and CMake, in C++, with the sole purpose of training my coding skills
in this language (game oriented-wise).

The concept or premise for this game was to create a simple 2D crawler game.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the scripts directory in the DungeonZ root folder.
3. Run the 'generate.bat' batch script to generate the CMake project and solution.
4. Run the 'build.bat' batch script to build the project.
5. Access the <TO DO look up the build directory> build folder.
6. Run the <TO DO look up the executable> game executable.
7. Enjoy!
